        With over $2.5 Billion in NFT Sales already, the world is changing at
        the speed of light. Brands, Artists, Filmmakers, and Athletes all are
        part of the NFT revolution. For the new generation of digital
        collectors, NFT is a new asset class. It is a new tokenization paradigm,
        which gives you the brand leverage to instill an "authentic" feel in
        your first copies. Create an emotionally charged revenue base for your
        art, ideas, and products. 'NFT' your ideas, feelings, unpublished works,
        and the most dynamic moments of life to monetize your value perpetually
        through royalties. Be the first to create a market of the future
        completely democratized for creators and fans.
